# Advent of Code 2023
A collection of solutions written in Python for the 2023 Advent of Code.

Directory Structure:
- days/: Each python file contains the solution for both scenarios for that day
- inputs/: Input files for each day. This includes two subdirectories `test/` for test inputs and `actual/` for the actual inputs.
- tests/: Unit tests for the different scenarios
- utils/: Util files used across solutions.

To run the unit tests, run the following command from the `2023` directory:
`python -m unittest tests/<test-file-name>`

To run the program, run the following command from the `2023` directory: `python main`
